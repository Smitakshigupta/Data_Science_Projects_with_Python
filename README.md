In this repository, I will upload all the projects created using Python


Coronavirus pandemic using Polynomial Regression - This project was done a few months back when US was not so badly hit by the pandemic. I was trying to experiment with polynomial regression to see whether it works for this project. I intended to update this project again, but accessing the data from John Hopkins database feels very different. 



Insurance Expenses Prediction - In this project, I used multiple linear regression and extra tree regressor to correctly predict the insurance expenditure based on some demographic and behavioral characteristics. 
I tried to test this project with two different patients and the algorithms could predict the data appropriately.
